Contributing to Ymple-Commerce
--------------------------

Ymple-Commerce is an open-source e-commerce solution. Everyone is welcome and even encouraged to contribute with their own improvements.

Ymple-Commerce 0.1.0 is written mostly with Node.js and the framework Sails.

To contribute to the project, you should ideally be familiar with Git, the source code management system that Ymple-Commerce uses, with the official repository being hosted on Github:
* You can learn more about Git here: http://try.github.io/ (there are many tutorials available on the Web).
* You can get help on Github here: https://help.github.com/.
* Windows users can get a nice interface for Git by installing TortoiseGit: https://tortoisegit.org/

Contributors should follow the following process:

1. Create your Github account, if you do not have one already.
2. Fork the Ymple-Commerce project to your Github account.
3. Clone your fork to your local machine. Be sure to make a recursive clone (use "git clone --recursive git://github.com/username/ymple-commerce.git" or check the "Recursive" box in TortoiseGit) in order to have all the Ymple-Commerce modules cloned too!
4. Create a branch in your local clone for your changes.
5. Change the files in your branch. Be sure to follow [the coding standards][1].
6. Push your changed branch to your fork in your Github account.
7. Create a pull request for your changes on the Ymple-Commerce project. Be sure to follow [the commit message norm][2] in your pull request. If you need help to make a pull request, read the [Github help page about creating pull requests][3].
8. Wait for one of the core developers either to include your change in the codebase, or to comment on possible improvements you should make to your code.

That's it: you have contributed to this open source project! Congratulations!

If you don't feel comfortable forking the project or using Git, you can also either:
* Edit a file directly within Github: browse to the target file, click the "Edit" button, make your changes in the editor then click on "Propose File Change". Github will automatically create a new fork and branch on your own Github account, then suggest to create a pull request to Ymple-Commerce. Once the pull request is submitted, you just have to wait for a core developer to answer you.

Thank you for your help in making Ymple-Commerce even better!
